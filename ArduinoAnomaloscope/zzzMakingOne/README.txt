Instructions on how to build one of the arduino baseed anomaloscope are available at:
	https://github.com/liana-keesing/Arduino-Anomaloscope

Those instructions do not provide parts numbers or sources for the parts, however.  See the PartsList.xlsx for information on where we purchased parts circa 2021.

The diagram of the arduino shield shown in the instructions is for an Uno shield; we are using the Leonardo.  From reading on the web, it appears that the shields are basically compatible but that some Uno shields don't physically fit the Leonardo.  The shield in the PartsList.xlxs file does work with our Leonardos. It has labels that match up with those in the UNO diagram, but the physical locations aren't the same as the diagram shown in the instructions.  The two images ShieldFront.jpg and ShieldBack.jpg show pictures of the assembled shield we are using.
