arduinoHFP - For running heterochromatic flicker photometry. Contributed by Allie Hexley and students she is working with.  There is a README.txt in the directory.  This is written for Windows and will need a little futzing to get to work on Mac or Linux.  Note that you'll need to manually load the FlickeringLight.ino file onto the Arduino before the Matlab part will work. More direct control of the arduino is needed because the Matlab toolbox interface is not fast enough to flicker at the rates needed for HFP.
